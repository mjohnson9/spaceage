## Git

### LFS
This project uses an extension to Git called Git Large File Store (LFS). LFS stores large binary files outside of the repository to reduce the size of, and thus the time to clone, the repository. We primarily use this for maps, models, and textures. In order to work with these files, you will need to install LFS on your own computer. It can be downloaded from [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

### Flow
This project uses the Git Flow model for development. Git Flow is documented at [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

To use this development model, you can either create the branches manually or use a helper tool by the same name. The tool's installation instructions can be found at [https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation).
